 * An interface for simple generic container class having key-value (K,V) pairs.

 * The container key elements must be unique. There must not be key
 * elements in the container that equal each other so that 
 * element.key.equals(another.key) returns true.

 * The key elements must implement the Comparable interface.
 * Note that in this project, the equals and Comparable differ
 * from the recommended. That is, the usual situation (x.compareTo(y)==0) == (x.equals(y))
 * does _not_ hold. See also the `Coder` class comments, which is used as K in this project.
