/**
 * An interface for all visitors that visit Visitables.
 * 
 * It is the visitors' responsibility to control the navigation
 * in containers. That is, the containers do not "push" the visitor
 * around, but visitors need to decide which container elements to visit
 * and in which order, and call the accept method of the Visitable.
 * 
 * This gives flexibility to traversing the containers, since each
 * visitor can decide if they would like to visit the container
 * in different orders. For example, if the visitable container is
 * a binary search tree, each visitor can decide if they wish to
 * navigate the tree in:
 *
 * 1. inorder,
 * 2. preorder, or
 * 3. postorder.
